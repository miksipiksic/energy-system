# energy-system

The software program represents an abstraction of an energy system written in Java, and it follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The main characteristics of the program are as follows:

1. Energy System Abstraction: The program models an energy system, which involves various energy producers and their associated batteries. The system aims to demonstrate the generation and storage of energy in a simplified manner.

2. Energy Producers: The system allows the user to add energy producers to the system. These producers can be of different types, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or hydroelectric power plants. Each producer generates a certain amount of energy based on its type and efficiency.

3. Producers and Batteries: Every energy producer in the system is connected to a battery. The battery acts as a storage unit for the energy generated by the producer. When the producer generates more energy than is immediately consumed, the surplus energy is stored in the associated battery for later use.

4. Adding Producers: The user can interactively add more energy producers to the system. To do this, they can click on a desired position within the program's interface and then press the 'Dodaj' (Add) button. This functionality allows the user to customize the energy system by placing producers at specific locations.

5. Hydroelectric Power Plant Requirement: One specific type of energy producer in the system is the hydroelectric power plant. This type can only produce energy if there is a water surface adjacent to it. This constraint reflects the real-world requirement for a hydroelectric plant to be located near a water source to generate electricity efficiently.
